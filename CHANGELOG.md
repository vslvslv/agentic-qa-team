## v1.2.0.0 — 2026-04-26 — Expand qa-refine to community sources

### Changed (`/qa-refine`)
- Added Phase 1b: parallel community research alongside official docs — fetches
  awesome lists (mxschmitt/awesome-playwright, grafana/awesome-k6,
  webdriverio/awesome-webdriverio, saikrishna321/awesome-appium), official example
  repos (grafana/k6/examples, wix/Detox/examples, microsoft/playwright-examples,
  checkly/playwright-examples), and targeted WebSearch queries per tool
- Replaced Anti-Pattern rubric dimension with Community Signal (0–25): rewards
  production gotchas sourced from community blogs, GitHub Discussions, and awesome
  lists — patterns the official docs don't document
- Added `[community]` source tags to reference guide entries so readers know which
  patterns are doc-blessed vs. battle-tested in production
- Added "Real-World Gotchas" section to reference guide template (community-only)
- Added gap→source-type lookup table in Phase 4 so each gap is filled from the
  most appropriate source type
- Updated final report to list sources used and annotate top findings by source
- Updated k6 official doc URLs to grafana.com/docs/k6/latest (new canonical location)

## v1.1.0.0 — 2026-04-26 — Add qa-refine skill

### Added
- `/qa-refine` — Iterative research skill: fetches official docs for Playwright, k6, Detox,
  Appium/WebDriverIO, scores the result against a 4-dimension quality rubric (0–100), and
  runs an autoresearch-style loop (score → find gaps → targeted fetch → rewrite → re-score →
  keep/revert) until score ≥ 80 or 3 iterations. Also makes surgical updates to the
  corresponding skill's SKILL.md.tmpl. Includes scoring honesty enforcement to prevent
  premature loop exit.

## v1.0.0.0 — 2026-04-24 — Initial release

### Added
- `/qa-team` — Orchestrator: auto-detects project type, spawns specialized agents in parallel, aggregates results into a unified quality report
- `/qa-web` — Web E2E agent: discovers pages/routes, writes Playwright specs, executes, reports coverage
- `/qa-api` — API contract agent: reads OpenAPI/routes, generates HTTP tests (status codes, schema, auth enforcement), executes via Playwright request context
- `/qa-mobile` — Mobile agent: detects React Native/Expo (Detox) or native iOS/Android (Appium + WebDriverIO), generates screen tests, runs on simulator/emulator
- `/qa-perf` — Performance agent: writes k6 load scripts + Playwright Web Vitals tests, runs with ramp-up profiles, reports p50/p95/p99
- `/qa-visual` — Visual regression agent: captures Playwright screenshots, diffs against baselines, masks dynamic content, reports pixel regressions
- `bin/setup` — Symlink-based multi-platform installer
- `bin/dev-setup` / `bin/dev-teardown` — Developer mode: live-edits via single namespace symlink
- `bin/qa-team-update-check` — Periodic version check against GitHub main branch
- `bin/qa-team-next-version` — 4-part semver bump calculator
- `scripts/gen-skill-docs.sh` — Regenerates `SKILL.md` from `SKILL.md.tmpl` sources
- `scripts/check-skill-docs.sh` — CI freshness gate: fails if generated docs are stale
- GitHub Actions: `version-gate.yml`, `skill-docs.yml`
